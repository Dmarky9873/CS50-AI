# Analysis

## Layer 1, Head 4

The model found strong relationships between word pairs like "turned" with "down" and "passed" with "through." It seems like this head's role is to identify relationships between two-word pairs.

Example Sentences:

- We turned down a [MASK] lane and passed through a small clearing.
- Daniel found a new pair of [MASK] that he likes to wear.

## Layer 4, Head 12

This head seems responsible for main words and finding relationships between them, cutting out the words that are less necissary to carry the main idea of the sentence.

Example Sentences:

- I enjoyed the [MASK] today, but it went a little too long.
- Don't go in [MASK]!
