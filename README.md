# CS50-AI

This is my work on the CS50 AI course that I took

### Why I did this?

I took this course because I believe that artificial intelligence is the future of computer science. Coding is relatively easy in a lot of cases and will be moved over to langauge models within the coming years. In order to remain ahead of the curve, I took this course so that I can be the one to make the programs that get rid of jobs, rather than have my job lost by someone else who did the same.
